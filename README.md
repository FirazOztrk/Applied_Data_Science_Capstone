# :üöÄ SpaceX Launch Success Prediction
Welcome to the SpaceX Launch Success Prediction project! This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and showcases the culmination of skills acquired throughout the course, focusing on a real-world scenario involving one of the most innovative companies in space exploration.

## üåå Project Overview
SpaceX has been a game-changer in the commercial space industry, largely due to their ability to reuse rocket components, specifically the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. By successfully landing and reusing these first stages, SpaceX can significantly reduce the cost of launches. In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a successful first stage landing, based on various factors such as payload mass, launch site, and orbit type.

## üßê Key Questions Explored
Impact of Variables: How do different factors like payload mass, launch site, and orbit influence the success of the first stage landing?
Historical Success Trends: Has the success rate of landings improved over time?
Best Predictive Model: Which machine learning algorithm provides the most accurate predictions for this binary classification task?
## üõ† Methodology
### 1. Data Acquisition
SpaceX API: Fetched launch data directly from SpaceX's REST API.
Web Scraping: Gathered supplementary data from Wikipedia using web scraping techniques.
### 2. Data Preparation
Cleaning & Filtering: Processed raw data to remove inconsistencies and irrelevant entries.
Handling Missing Data: Employed strategies to manage missing values effectively.
Feature Engineering: Applied One Hot Encoding and other techniques to prepare the data for modeling.
### 3. Exploratory Analysis
Visual Insights: Created visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
SQL Analysis: Used SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis of the dataset.
### 4. Interactive Visualization
Map Visualizations: Developed interactive maps using Folium to explore launch site locations.
Dashboards: Built dynamic dashboards with Plotly Dash to allow real-time exploration of the data.
### 5. Predictive Modeling
Model Building: Tested and refined various classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to determine the best-performing model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance through grid search and cross-validation techniques.
üöÄ Conclusion
This project not only demonstrates the power of data science in making predictions about complex systems like rocket launches but also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying data. Through careful analysis and modeling, we've been able to identify key factors that influence the success of SpaceX's first stage landings and provide a reliable model for future predictions.
